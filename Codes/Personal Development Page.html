<br>
<p style="font-family:Sofia; text-align:center; padding: 20px; background-color: #ff8080; margin: 50px; border-radius: 50px 10px;">The novel 'The Twelve Pillars' by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener is a novel that blends together the principals and teachings of Jim Rohn and his one year 
success plan, and with the help of Chris Widener, those principle have beem weaved into a unique tapestry of a fictional account of three characters, Michael, Charlie, and Mr. Davis.</p>
<h2 id="#D1" style="text-align: center; font-family:Sofia;">Chapter 4- The Gift of Relationships</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; background-color:#ffb3b3; margin:50px; border-radius: 10px 50px;">Developing solid, meaningful connections is highlighted throughout this chapter. The greatest pleasures in life, Jim informs Michael, stem from relationships—whether they be 
with friends, family, or coworkers. He gives advice that individuals should constantly put time and effort into their relationships and that having a solid support system is frequently a prerequisite for success. Jim emphasizes the need of surrounding oneself with upbeat, positive individuals 
for both professional and personal development. <br><br> Personally I think that this was a great start to this read. Not only have i always been a sucker for a sentimental opening, and although this was not the starting of the book, i feel like i got that in this chapter as started reading. Relationships, to me, are one of the most important thing for a human being
to have, and seeing Jim explain why, so beautifully filled me with satisfaction. It is important to understand that a 'relationship' does not have to be romantic, it can be with a friend, family or coworker. Regardless of who it is, having that support system, that network, makes the pyshce more positive
 and makes your environment all the more enjoyable and easier to navigate your everday life through. So i think this chapter was spot on. </p>
 <h2 id="#D2" style="text-align: center; font-family:Sofia;">Chapter 5- Achieving Your Goals</h2>
 <br>
 <br>
<p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; background-color:#ff8080; margin:50px; border-radius: 50px 10px;">Jim discusses the value of establishing and accomplishing objectives 
in this chapter. He advises Michael (the main character) to make a precise definition of his life's ambitions as objectives serve as a road map for achievement. Jim stresses the need for goals to be time-bound, precise, and quantifiable.
 He also emphasizes the significance of acting consistently and deliberately to accomplish those objectives. Setting and evaluating objectives 
on a regular basis will help you stay motivated and on course. <br> <br> I resonate with this chapter deeply, because for the longest time i found it extremly difficult to keep on track with not only everyday task but also my long term goals. 
Things like my career choices rremained inconsistent over the years up until my 5th year in highschool, where i knew i had to settle down and make a decision. My career choices went from being a Chef, a Music Teacher, a Musician, an Actor and finally and currently, a Software Engineer.
 So when Jim advised Michael to make clear definitions of his life goals, i felt as though there was no Michael, and that he was speaking directly to me. I also believe that even though his advise was 100% correct and accurate, i feel as though the advise of keep those ambitions <strong>consistent</strong> was
 missing and that, as well as the others, is extremely important in achieving your goals.</p>
 <h2 id="#D3" style="text-align: center; font-family:Sofia;">Chapter 6- The Proper Use of Time</h2>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; background-color:#ffb3b3; margin:50px; border-radius: 10px 50px;">In chapter 6,  Jim talks about time management, emphasizing that it's an important resource that has to be handled carefully. Michael is informed by him that successful individuals are able to set 
 priorities and concentrate on tasks that yield the greatest returns. Time should be set aside for connection building, personal growth, and completion of significant activities. Jim emphasizes that time is something that cannot be gained back, thus it's critical to efficiently manage time in order to make 
 every moment matter.<br><br> Hearing Jim talk about time management hits me right where it matters. Studying to be a software engineer feels like juggling a hundred tasks, and there’s always something new to learn, something complex to solve. When Jim says that time is a resource we can never get back, it makes
 me stop and think. I can’t afford to waste my time on things that aren’t moving me forward in a real way. I understand that rather than merely rushing to do everything, I need to set priorities and concentrate on the tasks and abilities that will have the greatest immediate and long-term effects on achieving my objectives. 
 It serves as a reminder that writing code for hours on end is insufficient if I'm not making the most of my time.<br><br> Effective time management is crucial for personal growth and interpersonal relationships, as it allows for a sense of accomplishment and prevents feeling behind.</p>
 <h2 id="#D4" style="text-align: center; font-family:Sofia;">Chapter 7- Surround Yourself with the Best People</h2>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; background-color:#ffb3b3; margin:50px; border-radius: 10px 50px;">Chapter 7 goes back to the subject of relationships, emphasizing the need of surrounding oneself with successful and happy individuals. Michael is advised by Jim that the people he spends time with have a big 
 influence on his achievement and outlook. Michael may improve his own life by hanging out with driven, ambitious, and supportive individuals. Jim emphasizes that friends and mentors should be carefully chosen since social interactions have a significant impact on one's personal growth. For both personal and professional success, 
 these chapters stress the value of relationships, goal-setting, time management, and surrounding oneself with positive influences.<br><br> I can relate to Jim's relationship advise, especially due to pursuing a career in software development. The attitudes and mindsets of others around me greatly influence how I view my own objectives and development. 
 Jim presents a compelling case for why the right people encourage you to keep trying new things, stay motivated, and stay focused. I've begun to understand how important it is to surround yourself with motivated and aspirational individuals who share your values about growth, whether they be mentors, students, or friends. Experiencing the 
 company of those who take their profession seriously serves as a reminder to stay focused and invigorating. In an industry that is changing so quickly, it also exposes me to viewpoints and ideas that help me develop.<br><br> These chapters consistently remind me that choosing the right company to go alongside me is just as important to reaching my 
 goals as my own hard work. The importance of surrounding myself with people that push me to improve while still supporting my goals cannot be overstated.</p>
 <h2 id="#D5" style="text-align:center; font-family:Sofia;">Overall</h2>
 <p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; background-color:#ff8080; margin:50px; border-radius: 50px 10px;">It was both inspirational and a bit of a wake-up call to read chapters 4 through 7. Jim's remarks made me realize how important some things that I may have previously taken for granted, especially in light of how they relate to my personal 
 and professional objectives. These four points should be remembered: <li style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; padding: 20px; font-family:Sofia; background-color: #ffe6e6; margin:50px; border-radius:50px;"><strong>The Power of Relationships</strong>: Whether on purpose or not, the people you spend time with have an impact on who you become. 
 Creating a network of driven, encouraging friends and mentors is crucial for personal development.</li><li style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; padding: 20px; font-family:Sofia; background-color: #ffe6e6; margin:50px; border-radius:50px;"><strong>Time as a Non-Renewable Resource</strong>: Jim's focus on time management helped me understand 
 the value of each minute. It all comes down to choosing how I want to spend my time: putting tasks that actually advance my goals first and avoiding distractions.</li><li style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; padding: 20px; font-family:Sofia; background-color: #ffe6e6; margin:50px; border-radius:50px;"><strong>Establishing Specific, Achievable Goals</strong>:
  I've discovered that in order to prevent feeling overburdened, goals need to be deconstructed and made feasible. Creating the momentum required to realize larger objectives begins with little steps taken consistently over time.</li><li style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; padding: 20px; font-family:Sofia; background-color: #ffe6e6; margin:50px; border-radius:50px;">
  <strong>Growth Beyond Career Objectives</strong>: Jim's emphasis on personal development served as a reminder to me of the value of investing in oneself, whether it be via education, introspection, or fostering connections. It takes more than simply technical proficiency to become a well-rounded individual.</li> <br><br> <p style="text-align:center; padding: 20px; 
  background-color:#ff8080; margin:50px; border-radius: 50px 10px;">I now have a stronger sense of purpose and a more defined framework for juggling my personal and professional aspirations thanks to these chapters. <br><br> The degree I am working is a Bachelors degree in Modular Computer Science. So far in my journey I have acquired three (3) skills. These are, a fast typing speed, 
  time management skills and increased work consistency.</p></p>
